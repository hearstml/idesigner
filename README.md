Fashion trends are constantly evolving, but a trained eye can estimate with some accuracy the signature elements of a particular designer's style. For this competition, we'd like to see how closely a ML model might do the same.

In this competition, you will try to predict the designer of the article or ensemble shown in each image. By solving this challenge, you will help researchers and editors better understand the unique features or the nuances that distinguish fashion designers and define fashion trends over time.

For more details on iDesigner 2019, please see our [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/idesigner). The 2019 competition, sponsored by Hearst, is part of the [FGVC6 workshop](http://fgvc.org) at [CVPR](http://cvpr2019.thecvf.com/).

## Tasks
Classify the runway images based on the designer of the item or ensemble shown. Categorical accuracy metric is used to score Kaggle submissions.

## Data set
For this competition, we have sampled 50,000 runway images, spanning 50 fashion designers, from our large repository of proprietary, front row images from fashion shows over the past 15 years. The data includes a variety of fashion items: shoes, bags, dress, jackets etc. Each image in the training set has a single label, the designer's name, which you will try to predict for the test set.

The test set contains 5,000 similar images, of which ~30% will be used to generate the public leaderboard during the Kaggle competition.

Please open an issue if you have questions or problems with the data set.
