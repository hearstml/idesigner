Fashion trends are constantly evolving, but a trained eye can estimate with some accuracy the signature elements of a particular designer's style. For this competition, we'd like to see how closely a ML model might do the same.

For this competition, we have sampled 50,000 runway images, spanning 50 fashion designers, from our large repository of proprietary, front row images from fashion shows over the past 15 years. The data includes a variety of fashion items: shoes, bags, dress, jackets etc.

In this competition, you will try to predict the designer of the article or ensemble shown in each image. By solving this challenge, you will help researchers and editors better understand the unique features or the nuances that distinguish fashion designers and define fashion trends over time.
